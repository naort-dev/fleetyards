  "Description": "Manufacturer: NV-TAC\nType: Flashlight\nAttachment Point: Underbarrel\nSize: 1\n\nThe FieldLite Red is a tough and tactical underbarrel flashlight. Featuring a corrosion-proof body and impact resistant lens, NV-TAC tested the attachment across a variety of environments and conditions to ensure it works when needed most. This special Red edition projects a red light in the shape of a circle. Ideal for situations when illumination on close range targets is essential without projecting a bright light that could be easily spotted.  ",
